# devember-2019

This is the code for my Devember 2019 project, which represents a series of
small plugins/packages/code explorations relating to Sublime Text package
development.

If you're not familiar with Devember, see <https://devember.org> for more
information on it. The rules of Devember include the requirement for not only
sharing any code written during the day but also a development log. For this
year's project, that will be contained in the [wiki](https://github.com/OdatNurd/devember-2019/wiki),
which includes links to any video DevLogs that are created.

During Devember, some of my development progress will also be live streamed on
youtube; see <https://odatnurd.net/live> for the live stream page.
